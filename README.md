**My Project**  
*Take a glimpse on some few projects I'v worked on:*

### Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring Pipeline
**Streaming Pipeline Using Dataflow:**

Real-time data streaming pipeline for environmental monitoring that ingests IoT sensor data from multiple sources (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, O₃, temperature, humidity) to visualize and analyze city-level air quality in Accra.

**Source:** IoT sensors in cities stream air quality data (timestamp, location, PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, temperature and humidity) levels every few seconds.
In this project, I used **Pub/sub to BigQuery**. The Pub/sub template is a streaming pipeline that can read JSON-formatted messages from a **Pub/Sub topic** and write them to a **BigQuery table**

**Pipeline:**
- Pub/sub (Raw messages)
- Dataflow (Custom User Defined Function (UDF) stage: clean/transform/enrich)
- BigQuery (Analytics-ready table)

**Dashboard:**
Tableau showing city-level pollution, alerts when thresholds are exceeded. 

**Impact:** Demonstrates environmental monitoring for smart cities.
